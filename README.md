# piradxatopboard

These are modified files for Radxa top board fan and screen that I am using on a Raspberry Pi 5.

1. Added option to show SSD temperatures on oled.py
2. Added option to show RAID usage on oled.py
3. Added option to control FAN based also on SSD temperatures which can be configured in rockpi-penta.conf file.

* Change SSD and RAID names based in your case. In my case the setup is like this.

4 x SSD (sda, sdb, sdc, sdd) and RAID 1(md0)

If you have this same setup and names you don't need to modify anything else.

Bye.
